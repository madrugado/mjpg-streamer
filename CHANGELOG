VERSION 2.0:
- uvc_streamer is more modular. All UVC dependend parts were moved to the
  input module "input_uvc". The name uvc-streamer becomes false now if more
  then just on input plugin is available. So the name was changed to
  MJPG-streamer.
- The output-plugin "output_http.so" can serve webpages now.
- Motor control was implemented in the single server available.
- Contrast, Saturation and Brightness can be changed via AJAX interface.
- A new output-plugin "output_file.so" can save pictures to a certain folder.
  It can also execute a command after saving a picture. If parameters are
  needed, write a shell script that executes your complex command.
- The project is hosted at sourceforge now.
- Example webpages are provided in the subfolder "www"

VERSION 1.3:
- moved the input thread and output thread into separate files
- renamed uvc_stream to uvc_streamer
- removed color.c and color.h because they became obsolete

VERSION 1.2:
- removed obsolete jpeg decoder source from "utils.c".
- changed occurences of (FILE *) to use (int) UNIX filedescriptors.
- added the subpage "snapshot". It's possible to get a single JPEG now.
  Just use an URL like "http://127.0.0.1:8080/snapshot" to get a single
  frame.

VERSION 1.1:
- Replaced the classic reader/writer IPC solution with a pthread broadcast
  condition. This should improve timing for higher framerates.
