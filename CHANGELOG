VERSION 2.0:
- uvc_streamer becomes more modular. All UVC dependend parts were moved to the
  input module "input_uvc". This leads to the new program name "mjpg-streamer".

VERSION 1.3:
- moved the input thread and output thread into separate files
- renamed uvc_stream to uvc_streamer
- removed color.c and color.h because they became obsolete

VERSION 1.2:
- removed obsolete jpeg decoder source from "utils.c".
- changed occurences of (FILE *) to use (int) UNIX filedescriptors.
- added the subpage "snapshot". It's possible to get a single JPEG now.
  Just use an URL like "http://127.0.0.1:8080/snapshot" to get a single
  frame.

VERSION 1.1:
- Replaced the classic reader/writer IPC solution with a pthread broadcast
  condition. This should improve timing for higher framerates.
